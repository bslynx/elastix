* Break Administrator: remove dead code.
* CallCenter Config, Agent Console, Agents, Break Administrator, Calls Detail, Calls per Agent: Use methods load_language_module and _tr from Elastix framework. Define them if they do not exist.
* Campaigns: improve speed and memory usage of CSV download of completed 
  campaign data by replacing single big SQL query by multiple smaller ones.
  Fixes Elastix bug #600. 
* Agents, Break Administrator, Calls Detail, Calls per Agent: make module aware of url parameter in paloSantoGrid::fetchGrid().
* Agents, Break Administrator, Calls per Agent: remove <form> tags from the filter HTML template. They are not required, since the template already includes a proper <form> tag enclosing the grid.
* Agent Console (programar_llamadas): restrict call reprogramming interface to
  requests with a valid Elastix session and authorization to the Agent Console.
  Also, clean up form code to use the default Elastix support for date controls.  
* Form List: fix breakage from i18n unification and remove useless code
* Agent Console: move around conditional declaration of getParameter so that
  it is available at the moment it is required.
* Dialer: Found probable cause of unexpected delays in outgoing calls. Asterisk
  AMI may emit events at any arbitrary frequency. If AMI manages to continuosly 
  emit events with less than 1 second delay, the event loop in the dialer will
  get stuck processing events (even if not interesting) and never dispatch any
  new calls. Fixed by forcing end of event receipt inside wait_response() method 
  in phpagi-asmanager-elastix.php. Might fix Elastix bugs #543, #577.
* Web interface: cleanup of i18n files to bring them in line with the rest of 
  the Elastix code.

1.5-3.7 (SVN revision 1843)
* Dialer: Add debug notification when record has just been inserted in 
  current_calls. Should help debug unexplained delays of call notifications in
  agent console.
* Dialer: Asterisk 1.6.x expects context variables separated by commas, not 
  pipes. Should fix Elastix bug #558.
* Dialer: asterisk 1.6.2.x emits Dial event with changed property name. Account
  for the difference in order to prevent access to undefined property.
* Reports (Agent Information): behave properly when no queues have been defined.
* Agent Console: protect private declaration of getParameter() in call 
  programming so that it does not conflict with Elastix 2 framework. Fixes
  Elastix bug #478.
* Trunks Used per Hour: fix over-complicated query for active trunks from 
  FreePBX database that resulted in misnamed trunk sources. Should fix Elastix
  bug #499.
* Campaigns Out: set array variables holding recordsets to NULL as soon as 
  possible in the CSV download codepath. This reduces memory usage and allows
  processing of a larger number of call records without exceeding the PHP
  memory limit. Also, for the same purpose, replace superfluous array 
  assignment via loop, with direct recordset assignment.

1.5-3.6 (SVN revision 1713)
* Configuration: detect and use generic-cloexec if available. Should fix issue
  of httpd failing to restart due to dialer process grabbing HTTP[S] ports
  as in Elastix bug #425. If generic-cloexec is not available, this has no 
  effect.
* Dialer: remove broken "reload" verb support from init script. Should fix 
  Elastix bug #434.
* Reports (Agent Connection Time, Agent Information, Trunks Used per Hour):
  remove hardcoded freePBX database credentials, and instead parse them from
  /etc/amportal.conf .
* Dialer: with low-quality phone number databases with lots of repeated 
  numbers, the generation of a call with the same number as one already
  being originated or monitored will confuse the dialer and mix up events.
  So skip over calls that duplicate calls already originated/in progress.  
* Dialer: if the AMI reports an OriginateResponse with a Success status, but
  the channel (or an auxiliary channel) has seen a Hangup, treat the call as
  a failure instead. 
* Dialer: when receiving a Link event before an OriginateResponse, do not wait
  until the OriginateResponse if the Uniqueid is known. Instead, fake an 
  OriginateResponse event to handle the call as soon as possible. 
* Dialer: prevent event re-entrancy when originating outgoing calls and pausing
  queue agents.
* Dialer: document more possible re-entrancy points where nested event handling
  could happen.
* Dialer: add debugging function to dump list of current_calls to log
* Dialer: phpagi-asmanager-elastix.php: factor out handling of queued events 
  into a separate function, and add events to the queue, not only on reentrancy,
  but also when the queue is non-empty. This ensures that any events already in the
  queue when entering wait_response() will be dispatched before any new events
  that were picked up on the event loop.  
* Calls Detail: fix broken chronological ordering of call records. Spotted while
  fixing Elastix bug #373.
* Calls Detail: when filtering by phone number, the SELECT statement for incoming
  calls failed to take into account that there might be no contact available for
  a given incoming call, but the Caller ID was available anyway. This resulted in
  missing incoming calls when filtering by telephone. Fixed. Should fix Elastix 
  bug #373.

1.5-3.5 (SVN revision 1563)
* Dialer: add and use new column to record timestamp of Originate execution for
  call. This is needed for upcoming support for outgoing monitoring 
  information. 
* Reports Break: rewrite introduced a regression in date select that prevented
  data from being fetched if the start and end date are the same. Fixed. Should
  fix Elastix bug #360.
* Dialer: fix accessing of undefined Uniqueid variable in OnDial event.
* Agent Console: recognize call attributes that are HTTP URLs, and display them
  as hyperlinks.
* Dialer: merge fix to prevent stale pidfile that happens to match an active 
  process from making the daemon hang on startup. See Elastix bug #356. 
* Agent Console: add interface for scheduling of calls to particular agents. 
  This support requires a specific context to work properly.

1.5-3.4
* Installer: The ALTER TABLE embedded in the middle of the SQL script to create
  the database will not work for creating the complete database in the clean
  install case. The script stops processing on the first error, so the remainder
  of the tables are not created. Embedding the creation in a stored procedure
  works in Elastix 2.0 but not in Elastix 1.6 due to Elastix bug #71. This makes
  it necessary to duplicate the schema check and update in PHP code.

1.5-3.3
* Clients: implement download of existing contact information.
* Clients: rewrite file upload support to resemble campaign upload code, and 
  detect charset encoding. Intended to fix Elastix bug #334.
* Agent Console,Campaign Out: remove HTML codes from French translations, as 
  they seep into CSV export output. Fix #2 for Elastix bug #325.
* Forms Designer: fix default selection of field type. Should prevent instances
  of Elastix bug #206.
* Calls per Hour: replaced implementation with newest implementation of Graphic
  Calls. Originally (deduced via diff) Graphic Calls was a fork of Calls per
  Hour, and it inherited major flaws. The fixed Graphics Calls implementation
  is now folded back into Calls per Hour. Should fix Elastix bug #336.
* Campaigns Out: attempt to detect character encoding of uploaded CSV file in
  order to always store UTF-8 data in the database. Currently detects UTF-8
  and ISO-8859-15. Should fix Elastix bug #325.
* Agent Information: (1/2) Replace questionable UNION statement that tries to
  fetch everything at once with three distinct SELECTs. The UNION mixed 
  different datatypes in several columns, resulting in a mangling of UTF-8 
  encoding for break names. This mangling required a workaround in the view 
  via utf8_decode(), which did not work at all with characters outside latin-1.
  The mangling and the utf8_decode() workaround are no longer necessary.
  (2/2) Rewrite report to use the new data structure returned by (1/2). Remove
  dead code from (1/2). Fix CSV export to not insert HTML tags in download. 
* Agent Console: fix issue in which a session or break is incorrectly marked as
  belonging to an inactive agent with the same agent number as the current 
  active agent. Should fix Elastix bug #329.
* Dialer: monitor additional instances of Uniqueid that can be associated with
  a given call and might hold additional call failure information in their
  Hangup events.
* Reports Break: complete rewrite. Replace inefficient time lookup, and fix
  no-data issue on CSV export, as well as HTML tags in CSV export. Should fix
  Elastix bug #324. 
* Dialer: add support for reopening of logs when receiving SIGHUP, and 
  implement a corresponding logrotate directive to make use of this.
* Dialer: record hangup cause code and description for a failed outgoing call
  Currently implemented only for calls sent through default dialplan.
* Dialer: verify that enterqueue_timestamp is set
* Campaigns Out: fix warning on line that start with a comma
* Agent Console: verify that $_SESSION['elastix_agent_audit'] is set
* Agent Console: report most causes of "spontaneous" agent disconnection
* Agent Console: implement ability to save form information after call is
  disconnected. To use properly, the Wrapuptime parameter in the queue must
  be set to an appropriate value.
* Agent Console: fix reference to string without translation
* Agent Console: fix incorrect javascript in time counter reset
* Agent Console: fix function call with insufficient parameters
* Calls Details: remove reference to not-used status variable, including use
  of undefined $_POST index.

1.5-3.2
* Form Designer: fix missing string translation
* Agent Console: fix reference for nonexistent icon image. 
* Configuration: allow to save settings that include blank login, and
  blank out the password in that case, to use settings from manager.conf.
* Dialer: store Asterisk 1.6.x Bridge event as Link in current_calls.
* Dialer: newer FreePBX versions store trunk information in table 
  'asterisk.trunks' instead of 'asterisk.globals' as previous versions did.
  The dialer daemon must look now on 'asterisk.trunks' if it exists. 
* Dialer: seems newer FreePBX versions store DAHDI trunk information as DAHDI
  not ZAP as previous versions. The dialer now needs to check under both names
  when supplied a DAHDI trunk.
* Dialer: use queue show instead of show queue for free agent report.
* Campaigns Out: modify CSV report of completed calls to add Uniqueid and all
  attributes defined for each call.
* Campaigns Out: previous fix for new campaign selection broke on old 
  Elastix versions. Fix it properly for all Elastix versions.
* Dialer: Handle Bridge event fired by Asterisk 1.6.2.x instead of Link

1.5-3.1
* Agents: Fix regression that prevented new agents from being created. Fixes
  Elastix bug #299.
* Dialer: Join event reports caller-id as CallerID in Asterisk 1.4.x and
  CallerIDNum in Asterisk 1.6.2.x. Account for the difference.
* Campaigns Out: greatly reduce time spent uploading a CSV phone file for
  a new campaign, by fixing an inefficient database operation. Also, set
  max_execution_time to 1 hour for the duration of the operation to prevent
  it from being aborted.
* Campaigns Out: fix inability to select a form for a new campaign due to
  mismatch in control name in javascript code. Fixes Elastix bug #296.

1.5-3
* Fix issue of /opt/elastix/dialer not being tracked by RPM and having wrong owner.
* Fix behavior of agent reporting to prevent mistaking no-agent case with DB error
* Remove declarations of getParameter() that conflict with existing declaration
  included in Elastix 2.0
* Merge new CallCenter reports into SVN:
  - Agent Information: show summary of agent, first/last disconnection, and 
    received incoming calls.
  - Agents Monitoring: real-time status of agents per queue, with total login
    time and number of calls
  - Trunks used per hour: Displays calls placed/answered/abandoned per trunk
    over a specified time period.
  - Agents connection type: displays summary or detail of agent sessions, with
    percentage of agent session actually spent handling calls, per queue, over
    a specified time period.
  - Incoming calls monitoring: real-time summary of incoming calls, grouped
    by queue and status. 
* Dialer: Always save start_time when marking a call as ShortCall. Should fix
  Elastix bug #262.
* Dialer: Remove per-queue counter of pending calls. This code is prone to get
  out of sync with the actual count of pending calls. Instead, store queue
  in call structure and count pending calls that match a given queue.
* Dialer: Fix assumption that Link and Join events will always occur after
  the OriginateResponse event. This does not always hold for calls made through
  the dialplan (Local/XXX@from-internal). Should fix issue of some calls not
  being detected when using dialplan for campaigns. 
* Dialer: An incoming call that is transferred should result in the agent being
  marked as idle in the database, instead of incorrectly keep displaying the
  information for the transferred call. Fixes Elastix bug #213.
* Dialer: rename a method to reflect context in which it is used.
* Agent Console: only build VTiger link if contact information for incoming call
  actually exists.
* Agent Console: fix case typo for reference to translated string
* Agent Console: tweak loading of language files to have English strings as 
  fallback if no localized string is available
* Break Administrator: fix reference to nonexistent translation string. Spotted
  and fixed by Jorge Gutierrez.
* Agents: detect and fail operation to add an agent if the agent already exists.
  Should fix Elastix bug #209
* Agents: remove obsolete parameter from method call that references an 
  undefined variable.
* Merge improvements to templates for Campaign Out by Franck Danard
* Display callerid as incoming number for incoming calls
* Add more missing strings and synchronize French translations
* Check that session variable is set before testing if not null.

1.5-2.1
* Dialer - do not fill log with notifications about origin of AMI credentials

* Agents: Merge changes from http://elajonjoli.org/node/25 to provide defined
  ordering of agent report and reloading just chan_agent, not entire Asterisk,
  when agent configuration changes. Tracked at Elastix bug #191. 

* Dialer - fix check for wrong column name that led to assuming nonexistent
  support for scheduled agents on systems that lack the required column 
  'calls.agent'.

* Agents: Major rewrite:
 - Remove empty directory libs/js
 - Add missing language strings
 - Translate Spanish language strings correctly
 - Rework interface code into separate procedures for each screen

   into single procedures.
 - Replace pattern of copying configuration file into temporary file
 - Improve interface to place agent removal functionality in main screen
 - Simplify loading and parsing of agent configuration file
 - Move filter HTML into separate template

* Dialer - Fix use of undefined variable in some code paths.
* Dialer - Fix bug in which an agent that belongs to both an incoming and 
  outgoing campaign will cause outgoing calls to be handled as incoming.

 - Code cleanup/refactoring to remove duplicated functionality between creation 
   and modification of a campaign.
 - Use rawmode for display of CSV data instead of a separate callable PHP script.
 - Improve usability of New Campaign/Edit Campaign with links to relevant 
   resource managers.
 - Display error message instead of form when trying to create an outgoing

   used by incoming campaigns.
 - Move out embedded HTML markup for report filter into a separate Smarty 
   template.
 - Rework query for campaign CSV data to be more readable.
 - Rework campaign report to make accessible more of the available

 - Remove vim swapfile unwittingly committed into repository
 - Remove unused template new.tpl and unused richedit library
 - Remove copy of jpgraph library and redirect references to Elastix embedded
   jpgraph instead
 - Rewrite code to remove write of query data to a temporary PHP file, replaced
