* Configuration: allow to save settings that include blank login, and
  blank out the password in that case, to use settings from manager.conf.
* Dialer: store Asterisk 1.6.x Bridge event as Link in current_calls.
* Dialer: newer FreePBX versions store trunk information in table 
  'asterisk.trunks' instead of 'asterisk.globals' as previous versions did.
  The dialer daemon must look now on 'asterisk.trunks' if it exists. 
* Dialer: seems newer FreePBX versions store DAHDI trunk information as DAHDI
  not ZAP as previous versions. The dialer now needs to check under both names
  when supplied a DAHDI trunk.
* Dialer: use queue show instead of show queue for free agent report. 
* Campaigns Out: modify CSV report of completed calls to add Uniqueid and all
  attributes defined for each call.
* Campaigns Out: previous fix for new campaign selection broke on old 
  Elastix versions. Fix it properly for all Elastix versions.
* Dialer: Handle Bridge event fired by Asterisk 1.6.2.x instead of Link

1.5-3.1
* Agents: Fix regression that prevented new agents from being created. Fixes
  Elastix bug #299.
* Dialer: Join event reports caller-id as CallerID in Asterisk 1.4.x and
  CallerIDNum in Asterisk 1.6.2.x. Account for the difference.
* Campaigns Out: greatly reduce time spent uploading a CSV phone file for
  a new campaign, by fixing an inefficient database operation. Also, set
  max_execution_time to 1 hour for the duration of the operation to prevent
  it from being aborted.
* Campaigns Out: fix inability to select a form for a new campaign due to
  mismatch in control name in javascript code. Fixes Elastix bug #296.

1.5-3
* Fix behavior of agent reporting to prevent mistaking no-agent case with DB error
* Merge new CallCenter reports into SVN:
  - Agent Information: show summary of agent, first/last disconnection, and 
    received incoming calls.
  - Agents Monitoring: real-time status of agents per queue, with total login
    time and number of calls
  - Trunks used per hour: Displays calls placed/answered/abandoned per trunk
    over a specified time period.
  - Agents connection type: displays summary or detail of agent sessions, with
    percentage of agent session actually spent handling calls, per queue, over
    a specified time period.
  - Incoming calls monitoring: real-time summary of incoming calls, grouped
    by queue and status. 
* Dialer: Always save start_time when marking a call as ShortCall. Should fix
  Elastix bug #262.
* Dialer: Remove per-queue counter of pending calls. This code is prone to get
  out of sync with the actual count of pending calls. Instead, store queue
  in call structure and count pending calls that match a given queue.
* Dialer: Fix assumption that Link and Join events will always occur after
  the OriginateResponse event. This does not always hold for calls made through
  the dialplan (Local/XXX@from-internal). Should fix issue of some calls not
  being detected when using dialplan for campaigns. 
* Dialer: An incoming call that is transferred should result in the agent being
  marked as idle in the database, instead of incorrectly keep displaying the
  information for the transferred call. Fixes Elastix bug #213.
* Dialer: rename a method to reflect context in which it is used.
* Agent Console: only build VTiger link if contact information for incoming call
  actually exists.
* Agent Console: fix case typo for reference to translated string
* Agent Console: tweak loading of language files to have English strings as 
  fallback if no localized string is available
* Break Administrator: fix reference to nonexistent translation string. Spotted
  and fixed by Jorge Gutierrez.
* Agents: detect and fail operation to add an agent if the agent already exists.
  Should fix Elastix bug #209
* Agents: remove obsolete parameter from method call that references an 
  undefined variable.
* Merge improvements to templates for Campaign Out by Franck Danard
* Display callerid as incoming number for incoming calls
* Add more missing strings and synchronize French translations
* Check that session variable is set before testing if not null.

1.5-2.1
* Dialer - do not fill log with notifications about origin of AMI credentials

* Agents: Merge changes from http://elajonjoli.org/node/25 to provide defined
  ordering of agent report and reloading just chan_agent, not entire Asterisk,
  when agent configuration changes. Tracked at Elastix bug #191. 

* Dialer - fix check for wrong column name that led to assuming nonexistent
  support for scheduled agents on systems that lack the required column 
  'calls.agent'.

* Agents: Major rewrite:
 - Remove empty directory libs/js
 - Add missing language strings
 - Translate Spanish language strings correctly
 - Rework interface code into separate procedures for each screen

 - Remove dead code from interface and module library
 - Store database connection in library object as done in other modules
 - Store message string in library object as done in other modules
 - Fix use of a session variable instead of input data for agent logoff
 - Centralize logging into Asterisk AMI into a single procedure
 - Rework library code to merge parameter validation and actual work code
   into single procedures.
 - Replace pattern of copying configuration file into temporary file
 - Improve interface to place agent removal functionality in main screen
 - Simplify loading and parsing of agent configuration file
 - Move filter HTML into separate template

* Dialer - Fix use of undefined variable in some code paths.
* Dialer - Fix bug in which an agent that belongs to both an incoming and 
  outgoing campaign will cause outgoing calls to be handled as incoming.
* Outgoing Campaigns: Major rewrite:
 - Code cleanup/refactoring to remove duplicated functionality between creation 
   and modification of a campaign.
 - Use rawmode for display of CSV data instead of a separate callable PHP script.
 - Improve usability of New Campaign/Edit Campaign with links to relevant 
   resource managers.
 - Display error message instead of form when trying to create an outgoing 
   campaign without   defining forms or queues, or when all available queues are
   used by incoming campaigns.
 - Move out embedded HTML markup for report filter into a separate Smarty 
   template.
 - Rework query for campaign CSV data to be more readable.

   functionality. Now the operations for Deactivate/Delete campaign are show in
   the report instead of having to use the View link.

* Graphic calls: Major rewrite:
 - Remove vim swapfile unwittingly committed into repository
 - Remove unused template new.tpl and unused richedit library
 - Remove copy of jpgraph library and redirect references to Elastix embedded
   jpgraph instead
 - Rewrite code to remove write of query data to a temporary PHP file, replaced
   by rawmode and proper query
 - Refactor code to eliminate repeating code for hour processing
 - Use SQL with GROUP BY and IF conditionals to replace PHP code that built 
   histogram from a direct query of calls
 - Move out HTML code for report filter into a proper template
 - Fix use of undefined localization strings
* Dialer - Fixed improper handling of multiple Link events for monitored 
  incoming calls that lead to temporary incoming call information not being 
  removed from the database
