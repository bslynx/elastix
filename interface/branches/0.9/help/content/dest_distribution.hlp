<h1>Destination Distribution</h1>

<p>The &quot;Destination Distribution&quot; option of the &quot;Billing&quot; menu allows us to view the distribution of outgoing calls grouped by billing rate in a graph.</p>

<p>The graph will change depending on the filters applied on top of the page:</p>

<table class="inline">
	<tr>
		<td>Start Date:</td><td> This is the date from which calls will be displayed</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>End Date:</td><td> This is the date until which calls will be displayed</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Criteria:</td><td> Distribution Criteria â€“ By Time, By Number of Calls, By Cost</td>
	</tr>
</table>
