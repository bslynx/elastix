<h1>Calling Card Platform</h1>

<p>The option “Calling Cards” of the Menu “Extras” in Elastix offers us the possibility of making international calls for a price that is lower than normal, through a number that the telephone company provides for making calls. These companies can be the typical telephone companies of each country or businesses specializing in telephone services.</p>

<p>The Calling Card Platform is based on Asterisk2Billing. For more information visit the Manufacturer Site at: <a href="http://www.asterisk2billing.org">http://www.asterisk2billing.org</a></p>
