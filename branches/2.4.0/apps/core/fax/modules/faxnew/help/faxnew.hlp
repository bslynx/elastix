<p>The option “New Virtual Fax” from the Menu “FAX” in Elastix lets us create a new virtual fax. You should have previously created an IAX extension in "PBX => PBX Configuration => Extensions => Generic IAX2 Device".</p>

<br />

<p>To create a new virtual fax, enter the name, e-mail, extension, secret code, country code and area code for the virtual fax (these are the mandatory fields). After this information is added, click on the “Save” button to save the virtual fax or “Cancel” to leave without saving.</p>

<p>Note that the extension of the virtual fax will be used to receive the fax.</p>

<p>Here are more details:</p>
