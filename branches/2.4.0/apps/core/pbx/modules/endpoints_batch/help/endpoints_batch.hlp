        <p>The option "Batch of Endpoints" in Elastix allows configuring many phones automatically by uploading a CSV file. It's recommended that all the phones in the file belong to the same. This file must contain at least 4 columns that are "Vendor","Model","MAC" and "Ext".</p>

        <p>Before starting the process make sure all the phones you want to configure belong to the same network than Elastix Server. The <i>Figure 2</i> shows an example of the structure of a CSV file with all available fields. The first four fields are mandatory.</p>
